With larger datasets - > tabular data

read help page for read.table!!!!!

rough calculation of the size of the data set. need to know RAM

set comment.char = "" if there are no comments in the file.

Use colclasses argument. 

Need to know when handling large data sets

- How much memory is available
- What other apps are in use
- Are there other users logged into the same system
- What OS
- Is the OS 32 or 64 bit

Calculating memory rows x columns x 8 bytes

= r X C X 8 / 2^20   bytes/MB

= #MB

= #MB/1000

= # GB

rule of thumb 2X the database

Textual formats

- dumping and dputing (contains metadata /dont need to know the classes) are useful because the resulting textual format is edit-able
- Unlike writing out a table or csv file, dump and dput preserve the metadata (sacrificing some readability)
- also useful when using version control like git so you can track changes better
- Unix philosophy - store all kinds of data in text
- downside not very space efficient

dput essential writes R code and recontruscts an R object.
